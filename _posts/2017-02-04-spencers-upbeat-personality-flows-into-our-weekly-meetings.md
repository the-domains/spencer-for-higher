  “Spencer’s upbeat personality flows into our weekly meetings and his openness
  about his own experiences makes him easy to relate to. With that said, he
  keeps everything very professional and oriented to your needs. Through
  goal-oriented conversations, Spencer helps you find your own solutions. I
  thoroughly enjoyed the service and flexibility. I recommend wellness coaching
  with Spencer for anyone looking to make positive changes in their lives. “
