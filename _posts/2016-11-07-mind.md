When I sit alone and ponder

All those deeds of virtuous honor

To downpour answers from the sky

Satisfying that eternal question, "Why"

My mind plays a cunning game

Influencing decisions that keep me the same.

Like a gangster fitting me with cement shoes

To drown me in the dark river of my "dues"

I've got to break through and accept life's offer

No matter the fear and pain felt from father.

I want to do right and I see it in lights:

Helping all others, lifts you to new heights.
