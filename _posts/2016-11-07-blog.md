# Parting with Panties: A Man's Tale
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/5d6ce4d4-fe87-4ae4-bd79-0717fc3f494f.jpg)

November 11, 2016

I volunteer as a yoga instructor on a U.S. Army base in the Bavarian countryside. I know that sounds typical, but this American dream has quite a journey attached to it.

Back in 2003, I was a weight-lifting, beer-drinking, steak-eating alpha redneck that once measured his life in the number of inches his truck was lifted in order to fit over-sized monster mud tires underneath it in order to desperately validate the "man card." I could tell you multiple ridiculous tales about courting that pickup's approval, but that story is for another time.

Fast forward to my life now as a yogi and a European vegan. Looking back there isn't anything left in my life, now, that could link me back to that time of hard-core, masculine idiocy. Except one thing: my black microfiber Under Armour panties.

I remember the first day I bought them as Gold's gym trainer in Boise, Idaho. I was so excited because I could finally get a pair of underwear that protected against the dreaded chafe I used to get regularly on the inside of my legs. I was secretly even more excited that they were the first pair of black undies I had, meaning that I could rectally exhale through them as much as I wanted without the memories of my younger and more innocent childhood full of Fruit of the Loom stains. White undies constantly and visually reminded the younger me of the more fitting slogan, Fruit of the BOOM.

All men know that wearing whitey-tighties doesn't provide confidence, because you're still wearing a modified version of the cloth diaper as a grown-ass man. Back then, "the industry standard" was universally known to allow only three or four episodes of flatulence to be filtered before permanently reminding you about your lack of self-control. Looking at the butt-end of a used cigarette will give you the parallel di"stink"tion.

My 15 percent employee discount looped me into paying $22 for the freedom and "come-fart-able" experience of wearing these spandex cheek-huggers, and I'm here to tell you it was worth every penny. They still reside in my top dresser drawer and I only bring them out in emergency situations. This is one such emergency as I'm behind on doing laundry. The XL spandex has lost its flexibility due to a number of different factors. Between their odometer reading and my lifestyle change, they now hang tattered around my plant-based waist.

There is no doubt in my mind that if it wasn't for these panties being made of spandex they wouldn't have lasted as long as they did, but they DO eventually wear out. It took ten years of wearing them at least once a week to finally burn a hole on the inside of the leg. I then proceeded to wear them for another two years until my wife had a serious discussion with me about my needing to dump my trusted friend of 13 years; my security panties.

It turns out that I'm not the only one, a survey by the Tommy John undergarment company revealed that 10% of men keep underwear 10 years or longer. That's longer than the average length of a first marriage. Another study in _Men's Health_ found that 28% of men wear the same underwear at least two days in a row. Clearly, I am not alone in my attachment to my panties. This information does not comfort my wife.

My wife calls them "panties" in her attempt to shame me out of wearing them, but it doesn't work. I know that someday I'll have to part from them just as [Candy had to part from his old worn out sheepdog in Steinbeck's, ][0]_[Of Mice and Men][0]_. If we had a gun in the house, my wife would gladly take my old friend out behind the house and shoot them right in the back of the ass multiple times. I'm having trouble letting go. I'm too much in awe of the journey these panties of mine made with me.

<iframe src="https://the-grid.github.io/ed-userhtml/?g=eJwlzUsKwjAQANC9pwhzgI4iFZSmWzcFUTdum2TqBBIj-TD09ope4L3BL3mOpMS7yhr6wxYUk39y1bDf9aBKthq41nc5IYpIt6ZWm6HOpogUDTl83M4XntbpfryC-nEmZUdZwxebQ0iytBCKzUSvccD_OG4-6Ngpow" height="244" style=""></iframe>

At this moment, I feel vast waves of empathy rolling over me as I reflect on the thankless job my spandex friend performed for me as the Earth circled the Sun 13 times. They've nested my genitalia in a fashion that kept my "eggs and bacon" from soft-boiling to the inside of my leg over several sweltering summers. Additionally, they've performed the civic duty of filtering the "winds of Uranus" for over a decade of eating meals as a man with tremendous heft in his appetite.

They have walked with me to strange houses only to be crumpled up and discarded on the floor of ex-lovers, helped support me in finding my love and held me during my wedding to Michelle. They've been jammed into multiple dresser drawers, back packs, and duffle bags. They've been fondled by the "heroes" of TSA while traveling world-wide from the States to Japan and all-throughout Europe without the need of a separate passport. Over the years they've born witness to my tremendous growth as a man and covered my ass on several occasions, never asking for anything in return.

Maybe this is why men have the hardest time parting with their panties; a man's panties are loyal and loyalty is an admirable trait in any form. Now, don't cry for me. I'll be fine, but I'm am conflicted on whether to throw the panties out, or give them a proper burial. I mean, it's the least I could do for my most trusted piece of fabric.

If I bury them in the garden, there is a chance that 13 years' worth of microfiber "fartilizer" could eschew the growing of a sprout in its remembrance. Perhaps giving them a Viking style funeral is more fitting where I ceremonially place them upon a burning pyre so that the physical matter of my spandex nugget catchers can combust, thus releasing their ethereal spirit towards the heavens.

But, my pro-environmental tendencies have me questioning if these are healthy options, so there is only one other option, as I see it. I could have them mounted and framed. Call it over-the-top if you like, but I see it as a tale of poetic justice. Is it fair that my most trusted friend, since 2003, end his days of service by being mounted and framed for attendance to his own wake 13 years later?

What is the proper ode from a man and his trusted panties? When is it really necessary to let go of your old security pair? I'm unsure how to say goodbye most appropriately, but as our long and valued relationship comes to a close I'm not that sad because the way I see it the life of my panties was a gas.

# Trading Places:Financial Health & Emotional Wealth

"Audaces fortuna iuvat (Latin)- Fortune favors the bold."

-Virgil

My family and I are American citizens living abroad in Germany, six hours into the future of the reality that is unfolding in Washington D.C.

Waking up to the fact that our next president is the quintessential depiction of gambling tycoon/hood "Biff Tannen" in Robert Zemeckis's _Back to the Future II_, was quite unsettling to say the least. You couldn't dream this scenario up; this is _really_ happening. Just a quick glance at the old Facebook wall this morning had me feeling as dreary as the residents of Berlin when they looked upon their wall for 28 years. The residents of social media continue to outpour their fearful desires to flee, hide, yell, surrender, kick and scream themselves awake from this perceived nightmare. I felt like doing all of this as well, until something shifted. I thought of the stock market.

I'm not as acquainted with the stock market as I'd like to be. In fact, upon hearing Wall Street jargon, I feel sick with regret that I never learned the language of money. I grew up in the 80's fearful of money because of the movies depicting the horrors of people losing everything in the stock market. Examples being Oliver Stone's _Wall Street_, Kevin Bacon's movie _Quicksilver_-yes I watched that, and of course 1982's _Trading Places_ starring Dan Aykroyd. His character "Winthorpe" permanently branded my brain with the image of him listlessly yanking a piece of Salmon from the inside of his Santa suit to drunkenly consume it while it's tangled up in his dirty-ass Santa beard. Hell, to this day, I can still hear the words of Don Ameche screaming after he learns he lost his entire fortune in only a few minutes imploring, "Turn the machines back on! Turn the machines back on!"
![Santa loves his sushi.](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c5af7722-9d13-4e09-b36d-8680a7d2014a.jpg)

As my life progressed, I chose to focus on everything else that the stock market wasn't; the beauty and grace of yoga, the compassion of massage therapy, the magic and rhythm of Djing, and most recently, health and wellness coaching to earn my Master's degree. I wanted to study wellness and everything surrounding that noble venture because I wanted to be able to heal myself no matter how dire the situation or how crazed the environment. Both Ralph Waldo Emerson and I are alike in that, we both seek out the divine lessons realized from self-reliance.

Back to now and the stock market. If there was one thing that I've learned over the years, it was the mantra, "buy low and sell high." The overarching idea is to buy a share when the market is depressed for the lowest amount of money, so that one day in the future when the environment and outlook improves, we can sell that same share for a handsome profit, thus enjoying financial freedom. Knowing this tidbit and seeing the alarming results of this election unfold, I said to myself, "Man, if I had money to invest in the market I'd buy a ton of shares right now while everything seems to be so dreadfully low." Then a bold epiphany came.

I don't have a lot of money, but I do have a currency to trade. In fact, when I look at my "portfolio," I'm brimming with wealth. So much so, that I can't stop smiling thinking about the fortunes that lay before all of us. This election has provided us a tremendous opportunity.
![Holy crap! This "opportunity" is giving me a headache!](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/5ac22e86-a77d-4fe0-88da-d07e8bd03ffa.png)

Looking from afar in my meta-view of the States, I see the majority of you feeling as low as ever; paralyzed with fearful thoughts of uncertainty. Health and happiness seem to be at an all-time low right now because the vast majority of you aren't even considering the very words I just mentioned. You just glossed over them unconsciously so, I'll say it again. _Health and happiness_ seem to be at an all-time low. Think about that.

What would it be like to dump your negative beliefs in order to free up the emotional capital needed to invest in the growth of your right to health and happiness? How would it feel to dump the antiquated and costly thoughts of pessimism and buy into the priceless value of health and happiness while the price of obtaining both of these are at an all-time low?

I see this as trading emotional places. There is a remarkable opportunity to trade your dead shares of fear for the infinite wealth of health. A conscious move like this would certainly make Emerson smile at your gallantry since he believed that "the first wealth is health." We have such a grand opportunity to become self-reliant in our inherent nature of becoming loving people whenever we so choose. Science proves that positive psychology and neuroplasticity build resiliency in the brain. By growing both it will improve the quality of your life. So make it a daily habit to nurture your seeds to grow wherever you might find yourself emotionally or physically.
!["Trust thyself, every heart vibrates to that iron iPod" ](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e0115b2a-75e9-4afa-bdc3-4eeaa0b93a38.jpg)

When you buy into this understanding, wear wealth's wreath proudly wherever you go. Whether it's at a grocery store where mobs of people are buying up all the bread, bottled water and batteries they can cram into their shopping cart, or the church where crowds are clamoring in droves to kneel before the possibility of hope and redemption. People will notice you wearing your new wealth, though they won't immediately put a finger on what is different about you.

Be aware that the tallest flower in a field of Daisies gets picked first. This means that people will start to ask _you_ about what you are doing that has your _being_ looking and feeling so vibrant. Tell them your story about how you became wealthy as soon as you decided to do so. Educate them on the strategies you used to turn your frown upside down right smack in the face of certain annihilation. Notice the swelling of your strength lifting your happiness even higher as you pass on the good work of the Gods.

Opportunities are to be had for the brave soul that realizes the magic and wealth of now. Just ask Virgil--"Fortune favors the bold." In these times that try men's souls all that can be done is to improve yourself, invest in yourself and believe that good will come. We cannot in these moments give up and it is our moral obligation to instead, endeavor to be the very best humans we can be and stand ready to bring better times to this world. In health and wellness, we can and will ride out this current turmoil.

# Soup and Salad
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/078bef53-ef59-44ab-b1ca-2fee8ce291ac.jpg)

November 8, 2016

The idea of soup and salad is metaphorically ambiguous.

What has come up for you in the past when someone offers you the words soup and salad?

Let me guess, "No thanks, I just want to get to my main course if you don't mind." There is something more to explore here.

I want to express that your daily health and wellness practice is as necessary as eating a salad before diving head first into your main course. I'm suggesting we get the proper nutrition needed without filling up on the richness of our chosen meal that will inevitably leave us feeling bloated and ashamed that we ate so much for pleasure and not for the health of the body. It seems we are hardwired to skip the things we know are good for us.

The main course represents a daily dose of what famous ring announcer Michael Buffer announces as "the main event." For many people, this main event might be work, digging into a promising career, or financial planning. It might be to study hard for school or to find a new mate and get into a relationship. It could mean creating, building, expanding, etc., etc. The point is that it is important to you.

Salad and soup are healthy choices that represent meditation and exercise, you know, the seemingly trite B.S. that's usually passed over in order to get to the things we'd _really_ like to consume. We want to indulge in the activities that exert the least amount of energy and offer the most pleasure; the activities that give us the quick shot, snort, and toke of dopamine the brain craves. The problem is that over time the same activity leaves us feeling unfulfilled eventually festering into a sadness of what could have been (depression) or morph into worry about how unprepared we are for the unknown future (anxiety).
![Kamakura, Japan 2012](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bab6d90e-d7ae-4f9a-a9ca-721fbad3e3cd.jpg)

This problematic message originates from our heart pleading its case to our brain. The heart wisely lobbies to the pleasure centers of the brain pleading that if they reach a mutual understanding, achieving radical self-discovery and intrinsic rewards for every entity involved in the experience. We inherently know this just as we are inherently aware that vegetables and yoga are healthy for us. Yet many of us ignore this insight due to our habits. Many of our habits work as the brain's defense strategy to keep our entire being unconsciously numbed due to the pain and guilt felt from continuously ignoring our heartaches by doing "tasks". Your brain may say it wants steak, though your heart begs for the meditation of a salad, the yoga that is soup.

Thankfully there is an antidote that exists that can be accessed any moment we are aware. The antidote is our awareness. Awareness allows us the mindful moments of self-reflection that inevitably guide us back onto the path we feel as righteous in our hearts and minds.

Think of meditation as our salad. An idea of a salad provides a variety of different experiences in a single sitting for the betterment of the body. The ego thinks otherwise. It communicates its displeasure with a nagging whisper, "This boring salad can't feed our hunger! The very thought of sitting here for this is a waste of _our_ precious time." I hear my wellness-seeking clients saying this about meditation practice often.
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bca06f25-080e-4e8e-a902-92b5c3b8c777.jpg)

Now, think of your exercise activity as the soup. Soup is more respected among peers and is accepted as being more than a salad. Soup's higher purpose is to warm your body and fortify you with strength to go out into the elements with more courage. Though the problem arises that when no one is looking (typically around February) we decide to do anything else but the soup.

It is important to note that a nutritionally diverse salad and a hearty complex soup provide all the nutrition the body needs for sustained life and that the rest of what we take in is to feed our voracious appetites. Ingesting more fiber improves the density of our very own moral fiber.

The sustained practice of overindulgence with food, work, Netflix, Facebook, etc., leaves us feeling heavy, mentally dull, and physically lazy due to the amount of blood and energy used to digest our perceived need for _more._ The silver lining is that this perceived need brought about the practice of fasting that has been evoked in a variety of different cultures for years in order to clear and purify the mind, body, and spirit. Heed this sage advice of fasting from time to time. Take a vacation from your damn appetites, life isn't always a Carnival cruise, but a carnival none the less.

So be mindful before immediately digging into your main course of tasks each day. Take the time to fork your salad, spoon your hot soup, and you will find that you still achieve satiety of mind AND body thus nourishing your spirit.

# Wake Up
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b432042c-bd2c-4c4a-ad99-132ab8d3dcf7.jpg)

November 7, 2016

We typically die earlier than we'd like. I figure that I'll roar towards that inevitable day with a proactive prolonging of time by waking myself up at 5:00 AM.

Voluntarily getting up earlier than you have to and at five a.m., much less, is crazy and in my crazed state I _feel_ intensely. I have more energy and I'm getting tasks done. I feel in greater control of my life knowing that the positives of waking up far exceed the negatives of snoozing. Like Benjamin Franklin said (allegedly because I wasn't around to hear him say it) "early to bed, early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise." Though Franklin had his own faults I now see how this logic applies.

Did I need to realize and accept that death is coming for me in order to feel that I need to live more fully? Perhaps. It seems that without death there would be no life, so to fear death is to fear it's antithesis. Accepting this law allows fresh reserves of creativity to seep into your soul, like flowing water. If something obstructs my flow, I'll trust inertia and the power of my healthy habits (like early rising) to simply go around it or rise high enough to float above it.

Lean on your obstacles long enough and they will expose their weakness to you, so be aware and prepared to see these obstacles become less and less. Time is perhaps humanities most common obstacle. How many times have you said to yourself, "I wish I had more time?" How many times have you heard others say, "I don't have enough time?" If we push against the obstacle, of time, we discover that we can make schedules, get better at planning, get better sleep and get up earlier---all to buy back some precious time and regain a feeling of some control in our harried lives.
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/93de7eb0-e72f-4e8d-8780-18dfc3ba739f.jpg)

Point out the subtle and not-so-subtle contrasts in your day; be someone who takes note. Becoming a great "noticer" fuels your life with the quantity of quality to subconsciously seek for answers. When one becomes a "noticer" and takes the time to notice one gains a greater appreciation for the beauty and subtle nuances of our world. Just this morning I noticed the way my dog's coat has come in so fluffy and full, I gave her an extra nuzzle. I noticed the brisk morning's burning air hitting my lungs and smiled to be so alive. I noticed the stepping tea and appreciated my wife for ordering such lovely things. People like you better when you notice them. You'll like yourself better. Getting up earlier facilitates the time to become a "noticer."

Fuel your willpower with glucose from natural food and emotion from your nature to attain what the dull mind labels as "unattainable." I often fast until noon. From rising to my first meal hunger gnaws and subsides and I remember the power of occasional fasting to clear the mind and create greater energy. At 40 some might say a fit body is beyond them or unattainable. Rising earlier allows one to exert willpower over the body's desires and make your goals attainable.

Overcome your blockages by being flexible and expanding your borders-- breaking down mental boundaries in order to let more creativity and life into you. This can be done by taking control of your time and gradually rising above your obstacles, altering your thinking and noticing all that you have to be grateful for.

Wake up and stretch your boundaries. You have nothing to lose.

# Yoga for Alignment

November 2, 2016

Yoga is union.

You'll find this definition varies from person to person though the essence of the word is agreeable among many yogis in that the practice of yoga aligns our body, mind, and spirit towards peace. This first blog post highlights the benefits Yoga brings to our physical body through asana.

My experience is that asana brings an acute awareness towards the current state of the body. I can feel the swells of subtle energy surging into my being feeling out the stiffness that is "log jamming" the river of my energy meridians and their involvement with the alignment of my blood flow, nerves, connective tissues, muscles, and bones. As I bend and move through the asanas, I notice how my body is positioned and how the energy flows through me to the point of cracking my neck, shoulders, knees, back, and numerous other joints to the point of greater alignment. The result is an enhanced circulation of blood, lymph, and oxygen aiding the body in recovery and strength gained in an improved posture.
![Proof that yoga can be performed in a silly hat.](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dd1db6bd-2845-408f-a286-62f432f6971b.jpg)

You are your greatest source of healing. It starts with you and your decision to get right in mind, body, and soul. You have the power to be your own chiropractor, doctor, or nurse while practicing compassion for yourself in the most artful of ways.

Try for yourself.
