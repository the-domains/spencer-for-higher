# Yoga for Alignment

November 2, 2016

Yoga is union.

You'll find this definition varies from person to person though the essence of the word is agreeable among many yogis in that the practice of yoga aligns our body, mind, and spirit towards peace. This first blog post highlights the benefits Yoga brings to our physical body through asana.

My experience is that asana brings an acute awareness towards the current state of the body. I can feel the swells of subtle energy surging into my being feeling out the stiffness that is "log jamming" the river of my energy meridians and their involvement with the alignment of my blood flow, nerves, connective tissues, muscles, and bones. As I bend and move through the asanas, I notice how my body is positioned and how the energy flows through me to the point of cracking my neck, shoulders, knees, back, and numerous other joints to the point of greater alignment. The result is an enhanced circulation of blood, lymph, and oxygen aiding the body in recovery and strength gained in an improved posture.

You are your greatest source of healing. It starts with you and your decision to get right in mind, body, and soul. You have the power to be your own chiropractor, doctor, or nurse while practicing compassion for yourself in the most artful of ways.

Try for yourself.

# Wake Up

We typically die earlier than we'd like. I figure that I'll roar towards that inevitable day with a proactive prolonging of time by waking myself up at 5:00 AM.

Voluntarily getting up earlier than you have to and at five a.m., much less, is crazy and in my crazed state I _feel_ intensely. I have more energy and I'm getting tasks done. I feel in greater control of my life knowing that the positives of waking up far exceed the negatives of snoozing. Like Benjamin Franklin said (allegedly because I wasn't around to hear him say it) "early to bed, early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise." Though Franklin had his own faults I now see how this logic applies.

Did I need to realize and accept that death is coming for me in order to feel that I need to live more fully? Perhaps. It seems that without death there would be no life, so to fear death is to fear it's antithesis. Accepting this law allows fresh reserves of creativity to seep into your soul, like flowing water. If something obstructs my flow, I'll trust inertia and the power of my healthy habits (like early rising) to simply go around it or rise high enough to float above it.

Lean on your obstacles long enough and they will expose their weakness to you, so be aware and prepared to see these obstacles become less and less. Time is perhaps humanities most common obstacle. How many times have you said to yourself, "I wish I had more time?" How many times have you heard others say, "I don't have enough time?" If we push against the obstacle, of time, we discover that we can make schedules, get better at planning, get better sleep and get up earlier---all to buy back some precious time and regain a feeling of some control in our harried lives.

Point out the subtle and not-so-subtle contrasts in your day; be someone who takes note. Becoming a great "noticer" fuels your life with the quantity of quality to subconsciously seek for answers. When one becomes a "noticer" and takes the time to notice one gains a greater appreciation for the beauty and subtle nuances of our world. Just this morning I noticed the way my dog's coat has come in so fluffy and full, I gave her an extra nuzzle. I noticed the brisk morning's burning air hitting my lungs and smiled to be so alive. I noticed the stepping tea and appreciated my wife for ordering such lovely things. People like you better when you notice them. You'll like yourself better. Getting up earlier facilitates the time to become a "noticer."

Fuel your willpower with glucose from natural food and emotion from your nature to attain what the dull mind labels as "unattainable." I often fast until noon. From rising to my first meal hunger gnaws and subsides and I remember the power of occasional fasting to clear the mind and create greater energy. At 40 some might say a fit body is beyond them or unattainable. Rising earlier allows one to exert willpower over the body's desires and make your goals attainable.

Overcome your blockages by being flexible and expanding your borders-- breaking down mental boundaries in order to let more creativity and life into you. This can be done by taking control of your time and gradually rising above your obstacles, altering your thinking and noticing all that you have to be grateful for.

Wake up and stretch your boundaries. You have nothing to lose.

# Soup and Salad
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/078bef53-ef59-44ab-b1ca-2fee8ce291ac.jpg)

November 8, 2016

The idea of soup and salad is metaphorically ambiguous.

What has come up for you in the past when someone offers you the words soup and salad?

Let me guess, "No thanks, I just want to get to my main course if you don't mind." There is something more to explore here.

I want to express that your daily health and wellness practice is as necessary as eating a salad before diving head first into your main course. I'm suggesting we get the proper nutrition needed without filling up on the richness of our chosen meal that will inevitably leave us feeling bloated and ashamed that we ate so much for pleasure and not for the health of the body. It seems we are hardwired to skip the things we know are good for us.

The main course represents a daily dose of what famous ring announcer Michael Buffer announces as "the main event." For many people, this main event might be work, digging into a promising career, or financial planning. It might be to study hard for school or to find a new mate and get into a relationship. It could mean creating, building, expanding, etc., etc. The point is that it is important to you.

Salad and soup are healthy choices that represent meditation and exercise, you know, the seemingly trite B.S. that's usually passed over in order to get to the things we'd _really_ like to consume. We want to indulge in the activities that exert the least amount of energy and offer the most pleasure; the activities that give us the quick shot, snort, and toke of dopamine the brain craves. The problem is that over time the same activity leaves us feeling unfulfilled eventually festering into a sadness of what could have been (depression) or morph into worry about how unprepared we are for the unknown future (anxiety).
![Kamakura, Japan 2012](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bab6d90e-d7ae-4f9a-a9ca-721fbad3e3cd.jpg)

This problematic message originates from our heart pleading its case to our brain. The heart wisely lobbies to the pleasure centers of the brain pleading that if they reach a mutual understanding, achieving radical self-discovery and intrinsic rewards for every entity involved in the experience. We inherently know this just as we are inherently aware that vegetables and yoga are healthy for us. Yet many of us ignore this insight due to our habits. Many of our habits work as the brain's defense strategy to keep our entire being unconsciously numbed due to the pain and guilt felt from continuously ignoring our heartaches by doing "tasks". Your brain may say it wants steak, though your heart begs for the meditation of a salad, the yoga that is soup.

Thankfully there is an antidote that exists that can be accessed any moment we are aware. The antidote is our awareness. Awareness allows us the mindful moments of self-reflection that inevitably guide us back onto the path we feel as righteous in our hearts and minds.

Think of meditation as our salad. An idea of a salad provides a variety of different experiences in a single sitting for the betterment of the body. The ego thinks otherwise. It communicates its displeasure with a nagging whisper, "This boring salad can't feed our hunger! The very thought of sitting here for this is a waste of _our_ precious time." I hear my wellness-seeking clients saying this about meditation practice often.

Now, think of your exercise activity as the soup. Soup is more respected among peers and is accepted as being more than a salad. Soup's higher purpose is to warm your body and fortify you with strength to go out into the elements with more courage. Though the problem arises that when no one is looking (typically around February) we decide to do anything else but the soup.

It is important to note that a nutritionally diverse salad and a hearty complex soup provide all the nutrition the body needs for sustained life and that the rest of what we take in is to feed our voracious appetites. Ingesting more fiber improves the density of our very own moral fiber.

The sustained practice of overindulgence with food, work, Netflix, Facebook, etc., leaves us feeling heavy, mentally dull, and physically lazy due to the amount of blood and energy used to digest our perceived need for _more._ The silver lining is that this perceived need brought about the practice of fasting that has been evoked in a variety of different cultures for years in order to clear and purify the mind, body, and spirit. Heed this sage advice of fasting from time to time. Take a vacation from your damn appetites, life isn't always a Carnival cruise, but a carnival none the less. 

So be mindful before immediately digging into your main course of tasks each day. Take the time to fork your salad, spoon your hot soup, and you will find that you still achieve satiety of mind AND body thus nourishing your spirit.
