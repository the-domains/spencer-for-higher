# Yoga for Alignment

Yoga is union.

You'll find this definition varies from person to person though the essence of the word is agreeable among many yogis in that the practice of yoga aligns our body, mind, and spirit towards peace. This first blog post highlights the benefits Yoga brings to our physical body through asana.

My experience is that asana brings an acute awareness towards the current state of the body. I can feel the swells of subtle energy surging into my being feeling out the stiffness that is "log jamming" the river of my energy meridians and their involvement with the alignment of my blood flow, nerves, connective tissues, muscles, and bones. As I bend and move through the asanas, I notice how my body is positioned and how the energy flows through me to the point of cracking my neck, shoulders, knees, back, and numerous other joints to the point of greater alignment. The result is an enhanced circulation of blood, lymph, and oxygen aiding the body in recovery and strength gained in an improved posture.

You are your greatest source of healing. It starts with you and your decision to get right in mind, body, and soul. You have the power to be your own chiropractor, doctor, or nurse while practicing compassion for yourself in the most artful of ways.

Try for yourself.
